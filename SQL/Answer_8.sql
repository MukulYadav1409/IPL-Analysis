-- ANSWER 8
-- Across most IPL venues, the toss winner wins the match only 48–55% of the time — barely better than random chance. 
-- This suggests that toss advantage in IPL is largely overstated. No major venue shows a consistently decisive toss advantage, 
-- indicating that team quality and execution matter far more than winning the toss.
